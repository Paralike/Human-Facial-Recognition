# Human-Facial-Recognition
Testing architectures for human emotion recognition in Keras
This git was created to collect many of the architectures which are capable of human facial recognition. This project was created for one of my classes in university
In this project, I not just collected but modified or wrote codes to have enough data to compare models. 
But because of it NOT all of these codes or code snippets are mine, but all of the authors are referenced in the original essay.
